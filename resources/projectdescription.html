<h2>Project Description - Silverbird Cinema Project</h2>

<p>
Silverbird cinemas owns movie theatres in various cities in Nigeria. Silverbird cinema has a website and rss feed that lists the current movies showing in each cinema.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong>
Silverbird website does not have enough detail information about the movies showing in the cinema.
So most times movie goers have to go to another site like imdb to check for movie  casts and director, reviews and ratings before deciding the movie they want to watch. Also the website does not have a mobile version, it is not user friendly to view on a mobile phone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Proposed solution:</strong><br/>
Design an app that will show the list of movies showing in each Silverbird cinema by reading their rss feed. The user should be able to filter the movies by cinema. The user can see more information about a movie by clicking on any movie in the list. Rottentomatoes api will be used to get more information about the movie that is not provided by Silverbird website, for example audience and critic rating, critic reviews.
